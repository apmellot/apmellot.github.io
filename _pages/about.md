With a PhD in signal and image processing for the Université Paris-Saclay, I specialize in machine learning and domain adaptation applied to biomedical signals.

I did my PhD in the [MIND](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) team at [Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-saclay-centre) under the supervision of [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/), [Denis Engemann](https://denis-engemann.de/) and [Sylvain Chevallier](https://sylvchev.github.io/).
During these 3 years, my research was to bridge the gap between advanced signal processing and real-world healthcare applications, leveraging domain adaptation techniques and Riemannian geometry for predictive modeling. In parallel of my research, I enjoyed contributing to open-source projects like [Skada](https://scikit-adaptation.github.io/), [Benchopt](https://benchopt.github.io/) or [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html).

Previously, I graduated from the engineering school [Institut d'Optique Graduate School](https://www.institutoptique.fr/) in signal processing. I also obtained the [Master Computational Neurosciences and Neuroengineering](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/biologie-sante/m2-computational-neurosciences-and-neuroengineering) at Université Paris Saclay.
